It can have detrimental effects on physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. \n",

            "One of the biggest concerns about environmental stress is its far-reaching consequences. It affects not only individuals but also communities and the entire planet. As humans continue to exploit and damage the environment, the effects of environmental stress are becoming more widespread and severe. This can lead to a vicious cycle, where the stress caused by environmental issues only exacerbates the problems further.\n",

            "Moreover, environmental stress can also result in conflicts and inequalities. As resources become scarce and climate change leads to displacement, competition for resources and land can arise, leading to tensions between different groups. This can also widen the gap between developed and developing countries, as the former have greater resources to cope with environmental stress while the latter are more vulnerable.\n",

In addition, exposure to air and water pollution can also lead to physical health problems, such as respiratory diseases\n"

Before this law was established, it was believed that substances could be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction. However, Lavoisier's experiments and observations proved this to be false and instead showed that the mass of substances involved in a reaction remains constant.\n",
