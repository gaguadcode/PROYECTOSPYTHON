        "text = \"The theory of relativity is a theory in the field of physics that describes the law of gravitation and the laws of physics within an inertial frame of reference. It was developed by Albert Einstein, who published it in 1915. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. According to the theory of relativity, the perception of time is relative to the observer and can vary depending on the speed at which they are moving. Furthermore, it states that the mass of an object can warp space-time, creating what we perceive as gravity\"\n",
